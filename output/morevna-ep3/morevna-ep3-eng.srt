Morevna Project...

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,000
...in association with "Adamant" Art School of Gorno-Altaisk...

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,240
presents

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,400
"Falcon", "Falcon", respond. This is "Hawk". What's your status?

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,680
Hey officer, can I help you somehow?

6
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,560
Stay away, stay away!

7
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,600
I am a government agent!

8
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,120
I know, I know...

9
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,560
And I am the owner of this mansion.

10
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:45,040
Ah, Marya Morevna, I just don't get it. We aren't that rich...

11
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,560
...but they are coming here like bees to a...

12
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,360
...honeypot!

13
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,560
I am not a bee, I am a "Hawk".

14
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,600
Spread your wings, Hawk.

15
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,360
But it seems like you're having fun.

16
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,200
Of course I am!

17
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,160
But still, why did you drop my favorite toolbox on him?

18
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,720
I just can't figure out what you did to them if they're after you so much...

19
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,160
I have no idea.

20
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,280
Going somewhere?

21
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,240
I am going to a biker party, and I won't be back until tomorrow.

22
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,160
Dinner on plate, firewood in shed, dog food under sink...

23
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,760
Do we have dogs here?

24
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,680
...in case of a power outage, turn on the electric generator and don't forget to restart the air defense system.

25
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,120
Here are the keys to all of the doors in the mansion.

26
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,560
Feel free to go anywhere, but don't touch this key and don't unlock the door.

27
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,600
But why?

28
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,160
Just don't!

29
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,120
Well, bye...

30
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,760
So dear, now I can have some fun with you then.

31
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,440
Hm, it seems this lovely evening is in danger.

32
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,680
Stay here, I'll be right back.

33
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
Caption on the door: "Underground"

34
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,400
Aha, here it is!

35
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,200
What?

36
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,840
Could it be...

37
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,080
...feel free to go anywhere, but don't touch this key...

38
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,680
Hey, is anybody here?

39
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,920
There is something wrong with your engine here.

40
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,800
Damn youâ€¦

41
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,360
Ah? Who is it?

42
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,320
Come on...

43
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,280
My name is Ivan Tsarevich... and I am very good at fixing things.

44
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,640
Inside...

45
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,160
There...

46
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,400
The framework is quite unusual. It will be a challenge to get inside.

47
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,120
So, let's start!

48
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,840
Yes...

49
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,400
Excellent...

50
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,120
Well done.

51
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,600
Certainly, you've got talent...

52
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,240
This is not the hardest one...

53
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,080
Still, it's quite strange that it's so tricky to open this thing...

54
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,720
Well, that's all.

55
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,240
Open Sesame!

56
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,480
What's up? You are almost there!

57
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:14,520
I don't know... there seems to be some piece of paper here... I'm going to remove it now.

58
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,040
Oh, no...
