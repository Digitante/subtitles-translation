Morevna Project...

00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,780
...in association with "Ethic Cinema"...

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,510
...presents.

4
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,320
[yawns]

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,240
Oh, I fell asleep with the window open again...

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,760
Ufff... it's so windy...

7
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,910
...and why can I see Komona through the window?

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,240
Komona?!

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,990
THE CONTEST!!!

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,280
In previous episodes:

11
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,490
Pepper spent a lot of effort...

12
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,490
...preparing for the potion contest.

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,870
I must've...

14
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,000
...must've accidentally fallen asleep...

15
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,100
But...

16
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,320
But...where am I?

17
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,160
Oh!!!

18
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,580
Carrot! It's so cute that you took care of everything!

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,640
Meow!

20
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:16,040
You even thought to bring a potion, my clothes, and my hat!

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,670
Well, let's see which potion you brought.

22
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,040
So, what do we have here?

23
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,870
Whaaaat?!

24
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,840
Caaaaaaarrrrrooooooot!!!!!!!

25
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,400
Pepper & Carrot. Episode 6: The Potion Contest

26
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:43,120
As Mayor of Komona, I declare the potion contest...

27
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,080
...open!

28
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,870
Four young witches are participating in this contest!

29
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,540
Please give a huge round of applause!

30
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,620
It is an honor to welcome the ravishing and ingenious witch...

31
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,670
...from the great Technologist's Union!!!..

32
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,780
Coriander!

33
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,710
And don't forget about our local girl, Komona's very own witch...

34
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,960
Saffron!

35
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,920
Our third participant...

36
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,580
...comes to us from the lands of the setting moons...

37
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,920
...the mysterious...

38
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,340
...Shichimi!

39
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,520
And finally our last participant, from the forest of Squirrel's End...

40
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,300
...Pepper.

41
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,780
Ladies and gentlemen!

42
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:56,460
The winner of the grand prize will be determined by applaud-o-meter!

43
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,420
Let the games begin!

44
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,370
[shouting] Well! First up Coriander's demonstration.

45
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,500
Ladies & gentlemen...

46
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,040
...fear death no more, thanks to my...

47
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,370
...Potion of Zombification!

48
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,700
Amazing!

49
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,180
With this mi-ra-cu-lous potion, Coriander defies death itself!

50
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,620
Yes-yes-yes...

51
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,520
A potion of Zombification..

52
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,200
that's nothing!

53
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,330
It's time to rate MY potion.

54
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,830
The real potion you've all been waiting for...

55
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,380
...The Potion of Poshness!

56
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,710
Fantastic!

57
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,750
Incredible!

58
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,800
This potion could make all of Komona rich!

59
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,580
It seems,  Coriander has already been eliminated!

60
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,870
Will Shichimi be able to beat that last demonstration?

61
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:22,700
I... I did not know we had to give a demonstration.

62
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,370
Come on Shichimi!

63
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,790
Everyone's waiting for you!

64
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,170
No!..

65
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,120
I cannot!..

66
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,200
It is too dangerous!..

67
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,640
S-sorry!..

68
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,750
Ladies and gentlemen...

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,500
...it seems that Shichimi forfeits...

70
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,420
Give me that!

71
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,370
CAREFUL!!!

72
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,480
What could be so dangerous?

73
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,460
You're just scared because your potion isn't as fantastic as mine!

74
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,900
No-no, it is a potion of...

75
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,840
...GIANT MONSTERS!!!

76
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,940
Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor!

77
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,260
Is it my turn now???

78
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,340
Run!

79
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,420
*МАМАААА*

80
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,260
You're lucky, Carrot; It seems nobody will see your wondrous potion...

81
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,600
She will destroy our town!!!

82
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,760
Wait,  I think I have an idea!

83
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:26,960
Hey!

84
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,060
You oversized-posh-zombie-canary!

85
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,370
Wanna try one last "potion"?

86
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,710
But first...

87
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,000
...read the label!

88
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,480
Read it carefully!

89
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,920
If you don't get out of Komona right away, trust me: I'll pour it all over you!

90
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,250
Understood?!

91
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:20,740
Because she saved our town we award first place to...

92
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,040
... Frøken Peber!
...Miss Pepper!

93
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,280
For her wonderful potion!

94
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,330
Huh, in fact...

95
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,290
...it's not really a potion...

96
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,580
...it's just my cat's pee sample from his last trip to the vet!

97
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,170
Isn't it, Carrot?

98
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,420
Meow!
