1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,120
So...

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:07,480
In the last lesson we completed linking the mesh to the skeleton.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,960
Despite the fact that everything seems to be working...

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,380
...it's not over yet.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,520
You have probably noticed that the rig...

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,040
...does not bend in the way one would expected.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,320
For example when we bend the jacket...

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,500
...we can see the things behind.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,680
We can fix this by editing the "Weights".

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,120
"Weight" is an indicator, showing the influence which bones have on the points of a mesh.

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,540
We can display them on the screen.

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,420
Firstly, turn on "Pose Mode".

13
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,260
Then, select the mesh that you need...

14
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,720
...and turn on the "Weight Paint" mode.

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,060
Finally, turn on the "X-Ray"...

16
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,040
...and select the bone corresponding to this part.

17
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,160
Okay.

18
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:08,280
Next, I shall explain more about "Weights"

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,580
The weight of each vertex...

20
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,060
...is visualized by a certain color.

21
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,460
A vertex drawn in blue indicates that the bone...

22
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,720
...doesn't have any influence on it.

23
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,940
A vertex drawn in green indicates that the bone...

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,780
...has a small influence on it.

25
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,260
A vertex drawn in red indicates...

26
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,720
...a strong influence.

27
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,880
The weight paint tool...

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,740
...is available in the Tools panel of T-menu...

29
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,600
...when you are in Weight Paint mode.

30
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,780
Tool size can be changed by pressing "F" key.

31
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,680
Or using "Radius" slider.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,360
Let's take a look how the tool works.

33
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,820
First, make sure to select the "Mix" mode for it.

34
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,640
In this mode the tool works as same as...

35
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,760
...a simple brush in your favorite graphics editor.

36
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,160
Now let's take a look at other parameters.

37
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,820
The "Weight" parameter...

38
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,820
...changes the color...

39
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,360
...which will be used.

40
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:36,120
The "Strength" parameter is for brush pressure strength.

41
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,640
It's like... a transparency.

42
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,740
Now, let's fix the jacket.

43
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,220
Turn on "Mix" blend mode...

44
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,960
Then, change the "Weight" parameter to zero...

45
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,240
...this is corresponding to blue color.

46
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,360
Then the "Strength" parameter...

47
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,320
...I usually change to 0.2.

48
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,100
Now I need to make sure...

49
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,320
...that the bone does not influence on this area.

50
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,440
Let's check the result.

51
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,040
It looks much better, doesn't it?

52
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,540
Next we see, that the arm bends a little higher than it should be.

53
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,280
Let's fix it.

54
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,020
In this place I need to add the weight to the bone.

55
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,340
Change the "Weight" parameter to 1...

56
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,460
...and draw.

57
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,260
Done. Continue to fix...

58
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,860
...any places that you do not like.

59
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,960
Et Voil√°! At this point, we have a finished rig ready for animating like this.
