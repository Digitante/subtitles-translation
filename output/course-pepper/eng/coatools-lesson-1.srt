Hello friends!

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,940
On your screen, you can see a clip from the "Pepper & Carrot" motion comic

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,200
And in this video course, I'll teach you how to create such an animation.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,300
You can download files for this lesson by following relevant links in description of this video.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,060
If you purchased the full course, then you can find them included in the archive.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,840
For the further work we need...

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,080
GIMP...

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,780
and "Blender"...

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,400
...with the "COA Tools" addon installed for both.

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,160
Let's start with installing the COA Tools Addon in GIMP.

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,400
Open the downloaded COA Tools folder

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,660
And copy the file located in the "GIMP" folder.

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,740
Then, go to the GIMP settings folder...

14
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,360
...and find the "Plugins" folder.

15
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,240
Paste the file we copied from COA Tools.

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,800
Make sure that the addon is executable.

17
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,200
Done.

18
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,380
The COA Tools addon allows GIMP to export every layer into separate pictures...

19
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,240
...as a PNG.

20
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,460
The addon also exports additional information about the placement of each layer.

21
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,100
Now, let's open our ORA file in GIMP.

22
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:49,220
Here is the character you saw in beginning of this video.

23
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,440
Notice, it is separated into layers...

24
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,020
...so that we can animate it.

25
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,480
For some parts you can see several versions exist.

26
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,540
For example, there are different variants of mouth here.

27
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,120
Such parts should be grouped together. The grouping tells the export plugin to treat those parts specially and allow to switch them during animation process.

28
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,120
For all other other cases however,

29
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,380
the parts should not be grouped.

30
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,420
So, let's start exporting.

31
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,000
Click "File"...

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,080
...then "Export to CoaTools".

33
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,700
Next, enter the name and path of the scene.

34
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,780
Done.

35
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,580
Let's check the result.

36
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,140
As you can see, the addon created a folder where we can find all our layers separated.

37
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,880
Also, there is a file with the .JSON extension.

38
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,540
This file stores information about coordinates of each layer.

39
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:00,180
We will need it to import our scene into Blender.

40
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:06,220
But first, we need to install CoaTools addon for Blender.

41
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,940
Just like in the beginning, start by openning the downloaded CoaTools folder.

42
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,100
Open the "Blender" folder inside.

43
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,620
Here we can see another folder - "coa_tools".

44
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,440
We need to make a ZIP archive of it.

45
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,780
Done.

46
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,760
Next, let's run Blender.

47
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,000
Go to "File"...

48
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,680
User Preferences...

49
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,000
And find the Add-ons tab.

50
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,920
Then click on the "Install from File" button.

51
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,760
Select the "coa_tools" ZIP archive.

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,980
After that, find the installed Add-on.

53
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,060
Put a tick before it.

54
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,860
And click Save User Settings.

55
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:05,820
Done.

56
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,400
If you've done everything correct, then in T-menu...

57
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,280
(the one which is opened by 't' key)

58
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,580
...the "Cutout animation" tab will appear.

59
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,760
Let's import our scene".

60
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,900
Delete the start scene...

61
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,000
Now, you need to snap your cursor to the center.

62
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:34,160
To do that, you need to press the key combination "Shift+S"...

63
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,620
...and choose "Cursor to Center".

64
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,400
Then, go to "Cutout animation" in T-menu.

65
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,500
And click on "Create new Sprite".

66
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,740
A plain axes object is created. Our scene will be linked to it.

67
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,280
Now, press the "Import Sprites" button

68
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,080
And choose the .JSON file, which was created earlier.

69
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,000
VoilÃ !

70
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,740
We've successfully imported our scene into Blender.

71
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,160
Everything is in its place!
