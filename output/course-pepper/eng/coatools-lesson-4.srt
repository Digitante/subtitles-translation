00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,560
Lesson 4: "Advanced Rig".

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,740
So we have made a triangulation of our character...

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,120
...and now we need to create a skeleton.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,040
First of all, create a bone and arrange it on the body.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,640
Then, divide this bone into a several parts.

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,000
To do that, press "W"...

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,500
And choose "Subdivide".

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,520
Use the menu on the left to increase the count of parts.

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,100
The first bone will be responsible for moving the whole rig.

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,380
The second bone - for bending waist area.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,220
The third one - for the chest area...

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,140
...and the fourth bone - for the neck.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,920
Let's make two more bones for shoulders.

14
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,740
It will be faster to duplicate the neck bone...

15
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,680
...because they will be automatically linked to the body.

16
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,340
And then, we create three bones for the arms.

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,940
The first bone is from the shoulder to the elbow...

18
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,300
...the second - from the elbow to the wrist...

19
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,820
...and the third - is for the wrist itself.

20
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,100
Let me also remind you that we need to create bones for eyes.

21
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,980
Duplicate any bone...

22
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,480
...and put it over the first eye...

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,580
...then over the other...

24
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,460
...and one more bone between them.

25
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,560
Now bind the eye bones to the central bone...

26
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,760
...and the central bone - to the head bone.

27
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,520
The next step is linking the character to the skeleton.

28
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,120
You already know how to do that from previous lessons...

29
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,240
But that method only works for the parts...

30
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,860
...which are not expected to bend.

31
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,680
In general those are: eyes, hands, a mouth and eyelids.

32
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,980
For everything else we will use another method - ...

33
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,800
...linking "With Automatic Weights".

34
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,160
Before linking any part...

35
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,760
...we have to turn off the skeleton deformation.

36
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,020
Select the whole skeleton...

37
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,760
...then press Shift + W...

38
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,820
...next, choose "Deform"...

39
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,480
...and select "Disable" in pull-down menu at the bottom left.

40
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,700
After that pick the mesh and then the corresponding bones...

41
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,000
...which will be linked.

42
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,240
Then press Shift + W...

43
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,560
...next - "Deform"...

44
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,620
...and choose "Enable".

45
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,500
Then Ctrl + P...

46
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,160
...and choose "With Automatic Weights" in the pull-down menu.

47
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,980
Done. The part is linked.

48
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,820
Now do the same steps for other parts.

49
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,360
Don't forget about turning the deformation off.

50
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,220
Keep in mind, if you do not plan to bend a part...

51
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,960
...then you don't need to create a mesh for it and it's better to link the bones using the method from previous lessons.

52
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,240
When you have everything done, turn on deformation of the skeleton...

53
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,600
...otherwise, nothing will work.
