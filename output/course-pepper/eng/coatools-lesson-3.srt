00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,380
In this and the next lesson...

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,600
I will show you how to create a more advanced rig.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,860
So, let's start.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,780
Create a new scene and import the .JSON file

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,780
Let's compare it with the final result of this lesson.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,540
Take a look. Do you see any differences?

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,660
Neither did I.

8
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,980
Now, let's look at it in X-Ray Mode.

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,620
We can see that the final scene has a silhouette of our character, but...

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,720
...how is this useful? You'll soon see!

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,660
First, we will try to recreate the "finished" scene.

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,900
Right-click any part...

13
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,500
...and click "Edit Mesh" in T-Menu.

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:00,480
So, we are in "Edit Mesh" mode now.

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,500
Press "Alt + H" to display the picture frame.

16
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,040
Let's start.

17
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,800
Move the mouse cursor to work area...

18
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,120
...and left-click any place close to the picture.

19
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,860
Then, zoom out a short distance and create one more point.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And continue until we have outline of the whole picture.

21
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,980
Be careful! Don't step out of frame edges!

22
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,200
When you get back to the beginning...

23
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,040
...select the first and the last points and press "F".

24
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,840
Now, we need to fill our outline with triangulated mesh.

25
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,660
Select any point that you placed...

26
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,540
...then press "Ctrl + L"...

27
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,000
...to select all of the other points...

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,280
...and then press "Triangle Fill" in T-menu.

29
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,600
Done. Now we have to delete the picture frame.

30
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,480
We don't need it anymore.

31
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,480
Press "Alt + H"  again...

32
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,840
Select all dots of the picture frame and delete.

33
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,120
Finally, press "Finish Edit Mesh" in the T-menu.

34
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,740
Now let me explain what we just did.

35
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,560
Triangulation is a process of converting outline polygon to the mesh of triangles.

36
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,460
Look.

37
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,420
Every triangle is responsible only for the area where it's located.

38
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,080
Such a mesh gives us the opportunity to "bend" the picture.

39
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,740
Because of that we are able to achieve result...

40
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,280
...as you saw in the first lesson.

41
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,820
As you have probably guessed...

42
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,600
...we need to triangulate the whole character.

43
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Or more precisely, we need to triangulate everything that will be bent.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,680
Note that sometimes the triangulation process can produce "artifacts".

45
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,540
You should always check the mesh for these artifacts.

46
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,540
They can be easily seen in "X-Ray" Mode.

47
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,840
If artifacts are present, they will make a gaps in the picture when you animate it.

48
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,320
In most cases, artifacts can be easily removed.

49
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,740
Select the mesh and enter the "Edit Mode"...

50
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,340
Delete any vertex in the gap area.

51
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,240
Then, fill the empty places manually.

52
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,940
Select three vertexes and press "F".

53
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,120
Sometimes triangulation can produce a LOT of artifacts for a single mesh...

54
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,680
...in this case it is better to undo and triangulate the part from the beginning.

55
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,900
Well, the mesh is ready now.
