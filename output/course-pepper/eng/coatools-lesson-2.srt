1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,760
Now that the boring preparation is over with...

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,600
...let's start creating our first simple rig.

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,960
Creating our skeleton.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,380
Press Shift + A ...

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,640
...then "Armature"...

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,320
..."Single Bone".

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,120
Here is a bone, which we can easily move.

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,480
Currently we are working in "Object Mode".

9
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,680
But we need to switch to "Edit Mode"...

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,020
...to work on the skeleton structure.

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,860
So now let's move it to body.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,800
Like this.

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,580
This will be the skeleton base.

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,440
Then select the top of the bone, press "E"...

15
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,780
And move it to the top of the head.

16
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,460
This bone will be linked with head.

17
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,780
Notice, if we create bone from another bone...

18
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,500
...then the second one will be bound to the first.

19
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,660
Now, duplicate the bone and move it over the arm.

20
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,900
Repeat the same steps for another arm.

21
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,620
Now we need only to link our image to the skeleton.

22
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,400
But before that...

23
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,300
We have to switch from "Edit Mode" to "Pose Mode".

24
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,600
To link the character with the skeleton, you need to right click the image object first...

25
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,280
...then hold "Shift" and right click the corresponding bone.

26
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,780
Press "Ctrl + P"...

27
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,700
...and choose "Bone".

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,920
Repeat this step for all other parts.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,140
Also, we need to create special bones for the eyes.

30
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,420
Duplicate one of the bones...

31
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,220
...put it on the first eye...

32
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,920
...then on the another...

33
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,920
...and one more bone between them.

34
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,940
It will be responsible for controlling both eyes at once.

35
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,260
Now bind the individual bones to the central one...

36
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,820
...and the central bone - to head bone.

37
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,580
And then just link the eyes to their bones.

38
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,140
If you've done everything correct...

39
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,700
...when you move your skeleton...

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,320
...all parts of picture will follow it.

41
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,760
Well, this very simple rig is done.

42
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:39,080
Next you will see how this rig can be used in animation.
