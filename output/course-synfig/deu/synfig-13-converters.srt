1
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:11,810
In this lesson, I would like to tell you about

2
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,640
Let's take a look at this sample

3
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,740
Now, let's try to guess how many waypoints

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,170
18, 9 or 5?

5
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,440
The correct answer is...

6
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:34,210
Synfig Studio has powerful features

7
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:39,210
and now, I'm going to demonstrate them

8
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,640
Here we have a bee body and

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,710
Let's import bee and

10
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,010
Group them together

11
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,940
and scale

12
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:57,740
like this

13
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,340
Move the wing into the right place

14
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,010
and set its rotation center

15
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,010
Now we are going to add

16
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,640
In Synfig Studio, you can attach mathematical

17
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:21,140
Let me demonstrate how it works

18
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,140
Here, we have a circle

19
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,670
Let's select its origin parameter

20
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,660
right-click

21
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,830
and choose "Convert"

22
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,660
Here, we got a list of available functions

23
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,180
in Synfig Studio we call them Converters

24
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,730
Choose Random converter

25
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:44,910
Look

26
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,860
Now, our circle makes random movements

27
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:55,610
Notice that there is a small triangle mark

28
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,130
Click on it to see

29
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,460
The Link sub-parameter represents

30
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,160
Here, we can set a maximum Radius of variation...

31
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,810
Speed...

32
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,410
or Seed

33
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,960
This Seed value defines

34
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:42,660
To remove converter from parameter,

35
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:55,110
As you probably noticed, the random converter made influence to both X and Y axes of origin parameter

36
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,060
Now, let's try to make it influence only its X axis

37
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,880
To achieve this

38
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,530
add a plain Composite converter for Origin parameter

39
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,160
This converter doesn't produce any animation

40
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:14,780
but it splits our parameter to

41
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,110
Now, again, let's right-click on X sub-parameter

42
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,980
and choose Convert

43
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,730
Random

44
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,680
Now, our circle is randomly moving

45
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,210
and finally

46
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:49,160
I would like to show you one more

47
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,130
This converter changes

48
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,010
Linear Velocity

49
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,560
Let's attach it instead of Random function

50
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,860
It's not really necessary

51
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,330
Then I'm attaching Linear converter

52
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,380
the old values have been

53
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,160
Let's set "Rate" value to 1

54
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,880
You can see our circle is moving

55
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,730
and this movement is infinite

56
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,780
Now, let's get back to our bee

57
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,980
So, we want to animate a wing

58
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,660
For this, I set a Random converter to its Angle parameter

59
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,710
Right now, this gives almost no effect

60
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,430
That's because the radius value is set to 1

61
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:55,430
that means that maximum variation of

62
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,410
Let that Radius to 30

63
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,110
Much better!

64
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,330
But the wing moves too slow!

65
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,210
Let's set Speed value to 25

66
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,210
Great!

67
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,610
Let's take a look at the graphs

68
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,330
and yes... Make sure that you have

69
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,030
So... We have one wing animated

70
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,780
Let's copy it

71
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,860
Put it down

72
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,830
Move here...

73
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,480
and scale down a bit

74
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,560
We have a really cute bee now!

75
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,730
Notice...

76
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,560
that the second wing has a

77
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:48,680
that's because the Random converter got

78
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,450
We can make wings move synchronously

79
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:57,250
We have to assign the same seed value to both

80
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,670
Like this

81
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,930
But for my taste, it's better

82
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,730
So, let's revert our last changes

83
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:34,170
Now, let's make our bee to fly from

84
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,850
Join on Animation Mode

85
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,210
Set initial position

86
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,990
and final position

87
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,750
Now, it's flying

88
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,310
Right now, the trajectory of

89
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,450
but it would be very great to make

90
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,770
then the animation will look more realistic

91
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,910
Let's do that

92
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,090
In here, we will use the Random converter again

93
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,590
To make the things easier,

94
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,910
Now, it remains at the same place

95
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,830
We can create one more group

96
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,410
and attach a Random converter

97
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,170
But instead, I will show you

98
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:45,290
You probably remember that Synfig Studio

99
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:51,390
and here we will use one very simple filter

100
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,370
Here it is

101
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:56,950
See

102
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:01,130
This layer is very simple and

103
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,730
Now, I am attaching Random converter to it

104
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,130
Set Radius to 15

105
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,170
Done

106
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:21,190
Now, again, let's make our bee move from

107
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,730
Let's check the result

108
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,050
As you can see...

109
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:39,610
the Linear motion combines together with Random

110
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,170
You are probably wondering...

111
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,890
What is the advantage of the use of

112
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,690
Now, in this particular case

113
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,070
there is actually no advantage

114
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,910
but in some cases this approach

115
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:04,430
because it allows easily turn off the Translation effect

116
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,410
Look

117
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:10,610
So, we can easily enable and disable

118
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,590
It's very simple

119
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:20,570
Such approach with filter layers is especially

120
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,810
And finally, one last stage for our animation...

121
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,810
Let's add a background

122
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:33,470
So, that's all, our animation is finished now!
