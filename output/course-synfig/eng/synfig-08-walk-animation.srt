#8: Skeleton animation

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,260
Let's get back to the character we've made.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,900
Now we are going to make him walk.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,700
Let's put the character into initial position, just like this.

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,700
And then we switch into Animation mode.

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,240
We are going to have it take 16 frames to make a step.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,660
Move the time cursor to frame 16 and add a new keyframe.

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,830
Now we have to switch the legs position and move the whole figure forward.

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,800
But first I would like to mark the position of his fore leg.

10
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:53,160
For that purpose just create a small circle right here, as a marker.

11
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:01,300
Now we can switch the legs...

12
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,560
...and move the guy forward.

13
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:10,630
Like this, so this leg should remain in the same place.

14
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,900
And don't forget to switch the arms as well.

15
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,560
For now the movement doesn't look that good.

16
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,630
Obviously the character should raise one leg while walking...

17
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,300
...and the other should stay on the ground.

18
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,330
So we'll create an in-between keyframe and fix the pose.

19
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,760
Since this leg is the fore one, it stays on the ground.

20
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,060
And this one will go up.

21
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,860
I am clicking the bone point to mark it.

22
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,930
You can see it's highlighted now, so I can distinguish it from the other bones.

23
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:22,880
To make our animation even better, We'll put an emphasis on the moment when character shifts his weight to the fore leg.

24
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,660
Add a keyframe here...

25
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:32,060
...and then we adjust the foot to emphasis the step.

26
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,930
Like this.

27
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,160
The first step is done.

28
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,860
We'll make the second exactly the same way.

29
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,830
Mark the position of the fore leg...

30
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:00,560
Add the key pose, when a character has already completed the second step.

31
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,730
This pose is the same as the beginning.

32
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,200
So we can just copy the keyframe...

33
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,200
... and move the character to the right position.

34
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:20,360
Now we'll add an in-between frame again.

35
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,580
This time, this leg is on the ground...

36
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,760
...and this one in the air.

37
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,400
Then emphasize the movement at the step.

38
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,330
And now we have two steps ready.

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,860
For the third step you can simply copy the keyframes and keep moving the character forward.

40
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,130
But before we do that, let's name the frames to avoid messing up.

41
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,030
Let's name them as follows:

42
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,200
"0", "0-step" ...

43
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,420
"0-to-1", "1"...

44
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,830
"1-step"...

45
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,830
"1-to-0"...

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,960
...and, again, "0".

47
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,230
Now mark the position of this leg...

48
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,060
And copy the frames.

49
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,060
We properly need to go through all the keyframes...

50
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:56,330
...  and adjust the main bone of the character so its feet don't appear slip against the ground.

51
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,830
OK, it's done.
