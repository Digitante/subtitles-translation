#2: Your first animation

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,060
In this lesson we'll create a simple animation about a boy going to school.

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,060
This course includes a set of sample files, which you can use for exercises.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,140
Please download the workshop.zip bundled with this course and unpack it.

5
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,630
Let's take a look inside the "first-animation" folder.

6
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:33,100
Here we have a boy image. Next, the map image he would be travelling over.

7
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,860
All images are saved in the PNG format.

8
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:43,500
This is the format we use for bitmap artwork, since it  provides compression without any loss of quality...

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,700
...and allows us to save images with transparent background.

10
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,000
Now let's add the boy image to Synfig

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,060
Choose "File" - "Import" from the main menu...

12
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,560
then find the location of our sample files.

13
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,310
Go to the "first animation" folder...

14
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,560
...and choose the "boy.png" file.

15
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,720
Here we've got an image layer. Let's select it.

16
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:19,390
Every image layer has a set of handles which allow to transform it.

17
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,770
This handle allows us to move the layer.

18
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,700
The blue point controls the rotation.

19
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,560
Using this orange corner we can scale the image proportionally.

20
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,970
You can also scale along a particular axis by dragging the yellow points here or here.

21
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,350
Finally, this red point controls skew.

22
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,060
I guess you won't be using it too often. So, lets undo the last action.

23
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,100
You can also undo using the Ctrl+Z as in other applications.

24
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:17,810
Let's insert the map image, it's the "background.png" file.

25
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:25,310
As you can see, the image is too big. Let's select it and scale to fit the work area.

26
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,640
And let's send it to the back. Like this.

27
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:41,390
Now, I suppose, we also have to scale the boy and send him home. Selecting the layer...

28
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:54,640
By the way, you can zoom in and out the current view by holding the Ctrl key and scrolling a mouse wheel.

29
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,960
And if you keep the wheel button pressed, you can move over the work area.

30
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,360
Now we have everything in its place.

31
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,180
So, we want to make an animation of this boy going from home to school.

32
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:25,560
Obviously, at some moment the boy will be at home, and at some other moment he will be at school.

33
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:31,850
We have to switch to the *animation* mode and set the both locations for specific moments of time.

34
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,600
Click the green man button here to toggle the animation mode.

35
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:46,220
The green man becomes red and a red border appears around the canvas. This indicates that we're in the animation mode now.

36
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:51,060
When the Animation mode is on, all changes are recorded in relation to current time.

37
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:57,720
Let's take a look at the Timetrack panel at the bottom. It indicates that we're at the zero frame now.

38
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:04,020
We can change the current time by clicking this grey area.

39
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:14,430
Let's go back to frame zero. The boy is at home, everything is alright.

40
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Now go to the 48th frame and drag the boy to school.

41
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:30,640
Look, right opposite to the Transformation parameter two orange diamonds have just appeared.

42
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,560
These diamonds are called Waypoints. They indicate that a parameter has a new value at some moment in time.

43
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,560
Synfig creates waypoints when we change any parameter in the animation mode.

44
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,770
This waypoint indicates that the boy is at school...

45
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,530
...and this one indicates that he's at home.

46
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:01,020
Note, that the motion between waypoints is calculated by Synfig automatically.

47
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:10,560
Our animation is very simple, so Synfig can play it in real time without problems.

48
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:15,970
But for animation with higher level of complexity real time playback may not be possible.

49
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,230
That's why it's recommended to use the Preview feature. Click this button to open the Preview dialog...

50
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,140
Here we can set the quality value and preview frame rate.

51
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:42,060
Let's extend our animation a little. At the frame 96 move the boy to the store...

52
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,930
...and at the 115th frame - back home again.

53
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,810
We can go to an existing waypoint  and change its value.

54
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,520
Oh, this boy is skipping his classes now! He's gone to the cinema instead.

55
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,850
Also, we can adjust the speed of the movement by dragging the waypoints.

56
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,430
Move this waypoint from the 48th frame to 20th.

57
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:27,060
Now the boy is running to the cinema way faster than he used to walk to school.

58
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:34,260
You can delete waypoints by right-clicking them and choosing "Remove" from the menu.

59
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:39,850
Or, you can just hold Ctrl and Alt keys and click the waypoint with the left mouse button.

60
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:50,430
You can also copy waypoints. To do so, move the cursor right where you want a copy...

61
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:55,470
find the right waypoint... right-click it, and choose "Duplicate".

62
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,930
Now the boy returns to exactly the same position as he was at the start.

63
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,470
This trick is very useful when creating looped animation.

64
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,180
Remember, waypoints are only created in the animation mode.

65
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,430
Otherwise changes you make will affect every frame in your project. Let's try it.

66
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,020
Turn off the Animation mode... and move the boy.

67
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:32,260
Here we've got an alert asking if we really want to apply the change to the whole animation.

68
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,460
Let's click "Yes" and see what happens.

69
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:43,500
Now the boy is walking somewhere aside. Let's undo this.

70
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,800
Note that we only get an alert if we change animated parameters.

71
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,500
Otherwise changes are applied at once.

72
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,800
For example, let's try to move the background.

73
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,260
See, no alerts here.

74
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:09,200
So I guess we are ready for the next lesson. But first, let's save our file.
