#4: Simple character

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,360
In this lesson we're going to prepare a simple character for animation.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,800
Open the character-1 folder. Here you can find an image of our character.

4
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:24,200
The simplest way to create animation is to cut the character into pieces and re-assemble them together in Synfig Studio

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,430
...so we get something like a paper doll.

6
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,740
You can use any image editor to cut the character.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:38,830
The GIMP or Krita fit very well for this task - they both are free software, so you can download and use them at no cost.

8
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:47,800
When cutting your image into pieces, make sure they have some intersecting areas around the joints...

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,600
...like in a real-world paper doll.

10
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,860
Actually, you can also cut your image right in Synfig, but I will tell about this in some other time.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,700
Right now our main goal is to learn how to construct the character, so I won't focus on the cutting process now.

12
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,360
In the "character-1" folder you will find a pre-cut pieces to work with.

13
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,770
Here we've got a body, an arm, a head and a leg.

14
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,220
One arm and one leg will do, because they can be mirrored.

15
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,360
Note that each image must have a transparent background...

16
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,560
...that's why all of them are saved in PNG format.

17
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,120
So, let's start. Choose "File" -> "Import".

18
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:31,820
Find the location of sample files, go to the "character-1" folder and import the first file.

19
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:39,700
By the way, Windows and Linux users can import images by dragging them from a file manager right into the working area.

20
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:45,730
This way you can select multiple files at once and add them all.

21
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,440
So, here we have all parts.

22
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,030
We need to change their size to fit the screen.

23
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,770
Of course, we can scale each piece one-by-one, but there is a better way to do that.

24
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:06,520
In Synfig Studio we can group several layers together and transform them as a single object.

25
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,300
Let's select the layers we want to group.

26
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:14,230
You can select multiple layers by holding the Ctrl key.

27
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,200
Also, you can select several layers in a row by holding  the Shift key.

28
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,160
Now, click this button.

29
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:35,060
Much like the same as image layer, the group have handles to control its transformation.

30
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,000
Now let's put all parts to their places.

31
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,040
It's better to drop them aside first, like this.

32
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,900
And put them back together.

33
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,220
OK, here we need to change the order of the layers.

34
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,860
Now I'm going to show how to create a mirrored copy of the arm.

35
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,940
First, let's select the arm group and duplicate it.

36
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:27,260
To duplicate a group press this button, or right click on the layer and choose "Duplicate Layer" from the menu.

37
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,460
Here is an arm. Now we need to mirror it.

38
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,860
Just drag this handle to the opposite side. Like this.

39
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,860
When dragging the handle, try to place it to the same distance from the central point...

40
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,730
...otherwise the proportions will be distorted.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,900
Sure, it's still not 100% accurate but in this case it would not be noticeable.

42
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,280
But if you need a perfect accuracy, then you can mirror by editing transformation values manually.

43
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,630
Let's give it a try for a leg.

44
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:15,600
In the Parameters tab, find the "Transformation" parameter and expand it.

45
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:22,230
Here you can see a list of transformations available for the image layer.

46
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,100
We need to edit the "Scale" subparameter.

47
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:36,060
To mirror the leg along the horizontal axis we have to precede the X axis value with the minus sign.

48
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,730
Press "Enter" twice.

49
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,730
See, the leg has been mirrored proportionally.

50
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,840
Great, the character is fully composed now.

51
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,160
Let's try to change his pose - for example, rise his arm.

52
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,560
As you see it rips out of body and you need to adjust it manually.

53
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,760
We can fix this behaviour by changing rotation center of the arm.

54
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,660
Click the green handle.

55
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,900
Then hold the Ctrl key and drag.

56
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,060
Here.

57
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,900
Now the center is in the right place, so you can move the arm without a problem.

58
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,960
Now let's adjust rotation centers for the remaining parts.

59
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,640
It would be nice if our character could rotate the body.

60
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,860
If we rotate the body now, the head and arms will stay in their initial places, which's obviously a flaw.

61
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,000
All parts should move as a whole.

62
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:08,160
The solution is easy - you just need to group the arms, head, and body.

63
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,620
Select the layers...

64
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,800
Now select the group...

65
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,230
And move the rotation center...

66
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,700
So everything works now.

67
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,330
To keep things in order, we'll call this group "boy"...

68
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,700
...and this one - "body".

69
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,480
And one last thing to mention.

70
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,860
Let's click anywhere aside to clear the selection.

71
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,560
And then click any  part of the character, that belongs to the "body" group.

72
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:59,000
Note that when you clicked, it's the group content that is selected, but not the group itself.

73
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,900
That's not always desirable.

74
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,520
Sometimes we want the group to be selected when we click at any part of it on the workarea.

75
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,860
That's why each group has a special parameter, called "Lock Selection".

76
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,460
Here, If we turn it on, then clicking on any part of the group will select the group itself.

77
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,030
Like this.

78
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
At the same time we still can select any element of a group by expanding it in the Layers panel.

79
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,930
Right now we don't need to lock selection of "body" group, so let's turn it off.

80
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,700
So, our character is ready! Let's save our file.
