#7: Bones

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,400
In the previous lessons we have learned how to animate a simple character.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,700
This technique is great for simple animations.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,830
But it also has drawbacks: it's not very comfortable to control the character's pose.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,280
Every time we have to select particular part and only then it can be moved.

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,500
Moreover, we have to think about creating correct group structure.

7
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:31,830
If our character is just a little bit more complex, then we'll have to create many nesting groups...

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,230
...and it gets hard to manipulate them.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,560
For animation of characters and other complex structures you can use bones.

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:45,760
With bones it's very easy to create a skeleton like this and control a character.

11
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,660
Now I'm going to show you how to create such structure from scratch.

12
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,030
Open the "character-2" folder.

13
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,360
Here we have an image of a whole character...

14
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,730
...and all its parts separated.

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,760
First let's import the whole image. That will be our reference.

16
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,000
Next, add the separate parts.

17
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,600
Now group everything together and scale to fit the working area.

18
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,400
Now it's time to clean up the mess. Let's separate all the parts.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,600
For our convenience, let's make the image of the whole character semi-transparent.

20
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:54,560
Layer transparency is defined by the "Amount" parameter. Let's set its value to 0.5.

21
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,000
Now let's put all parts into their places.

22
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,530
Here goes the body... the head.

23
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,030
Then the lower limbs - the thigh...

24
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,860
the leg...

25
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,760
and the foot.

26
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,460
The second leg appeared to be above the body but it's easy to fix.

27
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,930
Just send it to the back.

28
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,660
All remaining parts are assembled in the same way.

29
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,430
It's kind of fun, like a puzzle.

30
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,130
And don't for get to save your work regularly.

31
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,530
Done.

32
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,630
We don't need the reference layer any more, so it's better to hide it.

33
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,100
Now we can add a skeleton layer.

34
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,680
Let's put it inside of the group, above all image layers.

35
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,530
Expand the group, select its first layer...

36
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:26,280
right-click it and choose "New Layer" > "Other" > "Skeleton".

37
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,060
So we have a skeleton layer created, with one bone.

38
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,860
Here it is.

39
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,830
The green point is the bone origin.

40
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,600
The brown one determines its angle and length.

41
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,900
Let's create one more bone.

42
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:53,900
Right-click at any point of the existing bone and choose "Create Child Bone".

43
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,230
And there the second bone appears.

44
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,560
It's subordinate to the first bone.

45
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,030
Look, when I move the first one, the second one moves as well.

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,160
But the second bone can move on it's own.

47
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,660
That's how the bone hierarchy works.

48
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,000
So, let's put the first bone into the right location.

49
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,330
It will be responsible for the position of the whole character.

50
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:22,900
The second bone is for the body. We put it here.

51
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,160
Since arms and head should subordinate to the body...

52
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,060
...we'll create their bones from the body bone.

53
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,160
Right-click it and choose "Create Child Bone".

54
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,900
Now we create a bone for the lower part of the arm...

55
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,360
...and from that bone create a child bone for the hand.

56
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,530
Repeat the same procedure for the second arm.

57
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:07,000
The legs should stay still if the body bends, so make them belong to the first bone.

58
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,830
Next, create a bone for the ankle and for the foot.

59
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,430
In the same way create bones for the second leg.

60
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,360
The skeleton is ready.

61
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,260
Although just now it doesn't affect any character part and moves on its own.

62
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,760
What we need now is to link all the parts to the skeleton.

63
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,300
To connect the body, select both the body layer and the skeleton.

64
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:49,660
Click the body, press Ctrl and click the skeleton in the layers list.

65
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,400
Next left-click the green point of body layer.

66
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,160
That way we indicate what exactly should be connected.

67
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:03,330
Then right-click at any handle of bone and choose "Link to Bone".

68
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,660
Done! The body is linked now.

69
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,260
Let's connect all the remaining parts in the same way.

70
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,930
If you have linked some part to a wrong bone, just link it to another one.

71
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,860
It will reconnect automatically.

72
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,560
The character is ready. Let's try to move him.

73
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,160
Note, that when I'm dragging the tip of a bone, the bone is automatically stretching the image.

74
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,130
That's helps a lot in most cases.

75
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,900
But sometimes this effect is not desirable.

76
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:57,260
The head is an example: we might want to bend it, but not to stretch.

77
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,300
No problem, for this very specific case each bone has a blue point, here.

78
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:08,030
It allows to change a bone angle without affecting its length. Like this.

79
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,960
If layer is linked to a bone, that doesn't mean it should be controlled using the bone only.

80
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,560
Nothing of the kind. We can still move it by itself.

81
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,600
The only difference, that now it moves relatively to the bone it has been linked to.

82
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,630
So transformations of the bone and layer are composed together.

83
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,000
Finally, one more important remark.

84
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:43,400
All parts of our character are located inside the group we've scaled-down in the beginning.

85
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,930
And the skeleton layer was placed inside of this group.

86
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:53,740
It is crucial since both a skeleton and the parts we are linking to it must share the same coordinate system.

87
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,740
If we create a skeleton outside the group...

88
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,200
...the bones will have different coordinates comparing to the objects.

89
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,960
You might not notice this while linking...

90
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,160
...but when you try to change a bone position, nasty things are sure to happen.

91
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:13,000
Let's save and close this file and I will show you an example about this.

92
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:20,130
Let's assemble a part of our character - just a body, head, and arm.

93
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,330
Suppose, we decided to assemble the arm like this: ...

94
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,000
placed it here...

95
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,830
then grouped...

96
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,560
...moved, and also turned.

97
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,700
As you understand, all the arm parts would be in the other coordinate system...

98
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,060
... because we have transformed their parent group.

99
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,900
Let's try to attach everything to a skeleton.

100
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:12,700
The body... head... and arm...

101
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,330
...all connected.

102
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,100
Now let's try to change the pose.

103
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:26,900
As you can see, the head and body are fine, but the arms just go wild.

104
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,630
That's all because of transformed group.

105
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,300
If the group hasn't been transformed, then everything would be fine. It wouldn't  cause any troubles.

106
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,960
To fix the issue we can get parts out of the group...

107
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,060
...and re-align them to skeleton.

108
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,030
But now we'll go another way.

109
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,930
Let's suppose we don't need our character to bend his wrist and elbow joints.

110
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:09,460
So one bone for the whole arm would be enough and we can connect the whole group to it.

111
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,500
Yes, you've got it right -

112
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,400
... the groups also could be connected to a skeleton in the same way as image layers.

113
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,740
But I guess you already figured out that an image layer actually is also a group...

114
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,600
...or, to be more precise, a Switch Group.

115
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,930
And the real image layer is located inside.

116
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,330
But I digress.

117
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:36,660
First, we have to disconnect the parts inside of this group from the skeleton.

118
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,360
Select the part you need...

119
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,860
...find the Transformation parameter...

120
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,600
...right-click it and choose "Disconnect".

121
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,280
Yes, this is the same way as we deleted parameter animation.

122
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:51,430
Don't get surprised. ^__^

123
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,530
Now let's link the group.

124
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,760
Done.

125
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:15,230
Well, that's it. In the next lesson will try to create a walkcycle for our character.
