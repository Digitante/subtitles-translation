1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,910
Now let's try to make the same animation in a bit different way.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,990
Our character will remain in the centre and the background will be moving.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,950
Like as we are walking with the character.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,880
Here, I have the file from the previous lesson.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,800
Let's remove all redundant keyframes and remove the animation of this group.

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:29,100
Now, put the character in the centre and move background to the left...

7
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,330
...so our character will have a space to walk.

8
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:40,850
Our animation will not fit into default 120 frames, so let's extend the time-line length.

9
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,860
Go to "Canvas" - "Properties". Switch to "Time" tab.

10
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:50,030
Here we can set "start time" and "end time" for the timeline.

11
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,630
Set 200 frames here.

12
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:58,320
By the way, on this tab you can also change dimensions of your canvas.

13
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,110
OK, now let's animate the background.

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:17,280
Not bad, but I guess that in some situations you'll want to be sure that the legs of your character...

15
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,770
...won't slipping on the ground.

16
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,490
So I'll show you how to achieve that.

17
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,150
Let's remove the last keyframe.

18
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:37,510
Now we have a static background again. Turn off the animation mode and create a small red circle...

19
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:42,030
...right near the toe.

20
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,170
This will be a mark of its position.

21
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:52,830
Now let's group the circle with the background. Turn on the animation mode and skip a few frames ahead...

22
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,020
...to the extreme point when the toe is ready to get off the ground.

23
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,650
Here it's the frame 14.

24
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:07,690
Now move background strictly in the horizontal direction by holding SHIFT button.

25
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:13,250
Align the red circle as same as it was on the zero frame.

26
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:21,790
We can move background more precisely by using arrows on the keyboard. Like this.

27
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:27,270
OK, on this time span we have character movement synchronized with the background.

28
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:34,570
Now open the Graphs Panel and examine the movement graph of background layer.

29
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:38,800
Move the time cursor to the end of our animation...

30
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:44,590
Set a keyframe... Switch back to Graphs Panel... and move the background...

31
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:51,160
...watching how the graph changes. Make a slope in this segment as same as here.

32
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,510
We need to have a single straight line.

33
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,020
As you can see the graph is slightly curved.

34
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,670
It means the motion will be nonuniform.

35
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,860
Let's fix it.

36
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:10,400
Go to the Time Track Panel, right click on this waypoint and choose a Linear interpolation.

37
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:16,580
Open Graphs Panel again and now we can see that the graph is represented by straight lines.

38
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,580
Now we can easily align their slope.

39
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:31,550
Well like this. Done. Now of character is moving synchronously with the background. And his legs do not slip.
