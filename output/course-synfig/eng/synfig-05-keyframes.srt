00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,830
#5: Keyframes

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,400
Our character is ready and now we are going to create a simple animation.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,780
Here, he is raising his left arm and then the right one.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,600
Looks simple? Let's take a try.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,080
Suppose, our character lifts his right arm in 10 frames...

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,060
...and then the left arm in other 10 frames.

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,360
It would be more convenient to change the scale of Timetrack.

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:32,930
Move the mouse cursor over the gray rule and scroll the wheel.  Like this.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,960
Now, let's switch to the Animation Mode.

10
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:44,200
Next, set the time cursor to the moment when the character should have his left arm raised - frame 10.

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,660
And rotate the arm.

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,200
After that the second arm should start moving.

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,630
Move the time cursor by 10 more frames.

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,960
And now rotate his right arm.

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,660
Let's check the result.

16
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,240
Oh, it looks like something is wrong.

17
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,980
Both hands start moving simultaneously from the zero frame...

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,930
...while we need the movements happen one after another.

19
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,730
This happens because the position of the second hand in frame 10 isn't fixated.

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,030
That's why is starts moving right from the beginning.

21
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,400
It's easy to fix - just move this waypoint to the frame 10.

22
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,400
Now it works.

23
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,630
Since this character is very simple, the issue is easy to fix.

24
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:49,200
But in general case we have to work with much more complex characters, constructed from a dozens of layers...

25
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,850
...and each scene could have several of them.

26
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:56,330
And each layer can have many parameters we need to keep an eye on.

27
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,500
Obviously we need some functionality to manage animation on a higher level.

28
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,500
For this purpose we have Keyframes.

29
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,680
Keyframes are often confused with waypoints but in Synfig they're not the same thing.

30
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,830
Waypoints remembers a value of particular parameter at particular moment of time.

31
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:26,330
While keyframes, are also linked to a particular moment, but remember the state of all layers at once.

32
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,060
Let's see how it works.

33
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,500
Let's try to re-create our animation from scratch.

34
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,260
First, we have to remove animation of both arms.

35
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,860
We already know how to delete waypoints one by one.

36
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,500
And also you can remove all waypoints for a parameter.

37
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,660
Just right-click a parameter and choose "Disconnect".

38
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,030
This method is especially useful when we have many waypoints.

39
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,120
OK, we have all animation removed. So let's start.

40
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,760
Keyframes are located on the blue strip, right here.

41
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:10,760
Every Synfig animation have first keyframe created automatically, here it is.

42
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,060
Our character stands at the initial position.

43
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,160
Let's make sure that the Animation Mode is enabled and go to the 10th frame.

44
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:30,000
By the way, here you can use a special key combination - hold Ctrl and dot key to move time cursor one frame forward.

45
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,060
Now create a new keyframe.

46
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,560
Right click...

47
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,360
Here we have a keyframe.

48
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,830
Let's rotate the left arm.

49
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,760
Done. Now let's get 10 more frames forward...

50
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,000
create a new keyframe...

51
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,900
and rotate the second arm.

52
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:05,900
Note that Synfig has added an extra waypoint to preserve the object state at the previous keyframe.

53
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,760
Now the animation looks as expected without any additional fixes.

54
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,160
Let's take a look at one more example of how keyframes work.

55
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,660
Let's create a new file.

56
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,300
This will be animation of a ball moving up and then back down.

57
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,660
We already have one keyframe by default.

58
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,600
It is used to remember the state of objects in the very beginning.

59
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,160
Create two more keyframes.

60
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,140
Go to the second keyframe, enable the animation mode...

61
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,930
...and move the ball upwards.

62
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,130
Now, 3 waypoints have appeared.

63
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:59,760
The middle waypoint was created because we set new position of the ball in animation mode.

64
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:05,200
And two others were automatically created to save the ball's keyframe positions.

65
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,900
So, the ball jumps upwards and falls back down.

66
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,830
Synfig also have a special panel with a list of keyframes.

67
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,700
Here you can name each keyframe...

68
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,830
...and quickly jump from one keyframe to another.

69
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,430
Just click the "Jump" label here.

70
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,360
It is very similar to a link in a web browser.

71
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:40,360
Now I'd like to illustrate how keyframes help to manipulate waypoints.

72
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,930
Let's get back to our character.

73
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:49,260
Here we have two objects animated - one arm and the other arm.

74
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:57,330
If we move a keyframe... all waypoints at this time location are moved as well.

75
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:02,230
We don't even need to select the objects.

76
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:07,630
Sometimes you might need to move a keyframe together with all its subsequent keyframes.

77
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:13,360
In this case, just hold Alt and Shift keys when you move it. Like this.

78
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:22,660
We can copy keyframes from one moment to another. Just as we could with waypoints.

79
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:28,500
For example, let's make our character return to initial pose at the frame 40.

80
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,260
Go to the frame 40...

81
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,960
...right-click this first keyframe...

82
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,460
...and choose "Duplicate".

83
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:45,700
As you can see, Synfig has created all required waypoints to put our character in the same pose as he was on the frame 0.

84
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:52,630
Also it is not necessary to have the Animation Mode enabled when we manipulate the keyframes.

85
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,700
And one more thing to consider:

86
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,460
when we delete a keyframe all its waypoints would be also deleted. Take a look.

87
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,130
Finally, I would like to show you one more powerful trick that we can do with keyframes.

88
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:14,500
After frame number 40 let's make our character to wave with his hand.

89
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,960
But in this case I won't be placing a keyframe for each position.

90
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,660
Instead, I will put one keyframe at the start of the action...

91
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,900
...and one at the end.

92
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,680
Done. Now I've got two events, two keyframes...

93
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:47,900
the character started waving his hand... and he stopped waving.

94
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,560
Now let's try to move the last keyframe.

95
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:03,430
And here's the trick: moving keyframes automatically scales the waypoints between them.

96
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:11,860
Look, how easy I can change duration of the whole action.
