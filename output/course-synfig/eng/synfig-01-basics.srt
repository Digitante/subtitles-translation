#1: Getting Started

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,520
Welcome to the Synfig Studio animation software training series.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,020
In this lesson we will learn about interface and basic concepts of Synfig.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:13,890
So, let's start!

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,500
During this course I will be working with the English interface.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,630
So you may find it more convenient to switch to English language as well while following the course.

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,310
It's easy to do - just choose "Preferences" from the "Edit" menu,

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:34,640
then go to the "Miscellaneous" tab, and choose "English" from the list.

9
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,430
After that you need to restart the app.

10
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,220
Now let's take a look at the main elements of the interface.

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,390
It might happen your Synfig installation is configured differently.

12
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,310
To restore the default layout, choose "Window" -

13
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,430
"Workspace" -

14
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,020
"Default".

15
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,600
So, what does the main window consist of?

16
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,270
In the center of the screen we have the main working area.

17
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,430
At the top of it you can find the buttons to save or open a file, ...

18
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:24,130
...undo or redo last action... and so on.

19
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,030
On the left we have the Toolbox...

20
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,970
...and some global tool settings such as the "Fill/Outline Colors" and "Line Width".

21
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,890
There are additional panels, below and to the right of the working area.

22
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:43,810
I'm not going to describe all of them in detail, let's just take a look at the most important of them:

23
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,560
"Tool Options"...

24
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,180
"Layers"...

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,970
...and "Parameters".

26
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:56,810
Let's see how they work. Choose the Circle tool in the Toolbox.

27
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,560
The Circle tool options have now appeared under the Tool Options Panel.

28
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:09,020
Make sure that "Create Circle Layer" button is enabled and all other buttons in this row are disabled.

29
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:16,140
Next, position the mouse somewhere in the workarea, press and hold the left mouse button.

30
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,810
Now drag the mouse until we have a circle and release the button.

31
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,390
Here it is, you've got a circle that looks like this.

32
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,600
Note, a new layer has just appeared under the Layers Panel.

33
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,850
That's it: every object in Synfig Studio is a separate layer.

34
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,130
Let's choose a different color and create one more circle.

35
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,390
The second circle also appears in the Layers panel.

36
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,720
Now let's switch to the Transform tool.

37
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,020
You can select objects using either the Layers panel or the working area.

38
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:12,310
When an object is selected, you can change its parameters by dragging these color dots. These dots are called "handles".

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,800
But usually objects have lots of other parameters.

40
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,860
You can change them in the Parameters Panel.

41
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:30,350
Here we have Alpha Amount, Color, Feather, and many others.

42
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,430
To edit a parameter, double-click its value.

43
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,180
Let's make some changes...

44
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,310
And press Enter.

45
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,560
In the Layers Panel we can switch the order of the layers.

46
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,460
Here we can duplicate them...

47
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,500
remove...

48
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,430
copy to clipboard, and so on.

49
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,000
For example, let's make a copy of this circle.

50
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,430
Press this button...

51
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,890
And now we've got a copy.

52
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,440
Now we can proceed to the next lesson.
