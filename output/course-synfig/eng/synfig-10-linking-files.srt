1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,480
Now, let’s get back to our animation of walking character.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,700
You can find it in the folder with other samples.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:16,350
Go to "сharacter-2" directory... then to "final"... Here it is.

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,700
Now we can add a backgrounds and create a scene like this.

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,040
Let's go to a directory called "bg-forest-1".

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:38,290
Here is a background image. If we just insert the image directly into the file with character's walkcycle animation...

7
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:44,330
These keyframes which are responsible for character animation will hinder us.

8
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,660
So I'll show you the other way.

9
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,980
Let's close this file..

10
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:55,150
...without saving changes. Create a new file and insert there the file with character animation.

11
00:00:55,150 --> 00:01:06,560
Choose "File - "Import". Go to "character-2" - "final". Here it is.

12
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:16,110
So we have imported an external animation file and it's shown as a group.

13
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,930
Now we can animate it as a regular image.

14
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,100
At the same time...

15
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:29,470
...the keyframes of current document will not affect an animation in the external file. Look.

16
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:37,250
Here, near the Canvas parameter we have waypoints that represent animation in the external file.

17
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,220
And they will stay in place...

18
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:46,160
...If I move the keyframes of current document. OK, now we have only to add the background.

19
00:01:46,260 --> 00:02:02,280
And don't forget to turn off animation mode.

20
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:10,130
Please note if we import an external animation file, its content won't be copied to the file it will be...

21
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,150
...linked.

22
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:18,290
It means if you change the external file, then all changes will be automatically propagated to all files...

23
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,410
...which it's linked with.

24
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:26,450
Now let's try to open the group of external file and to change something there.

25
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,210
Do you see? it doesn't work.

26
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,340
It's because the contents of the group belong to external file.

27
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,490
But we can open the file in a separate tab and then make our changes.

28
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,080
And all changes will be automatically propagated here.

29
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:09,720
And if we have external file opened (in seperate tab), then we'll be able to edit its content...

30
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,760
...right here in this document.

31
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:21,590
Do you see?  - there are no any errors.

32
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:29,290
One important thing to consider: if you click "Save" button, then only changes of current document will be saved.

33
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:33,810
All other files should be saved separately.

34
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:40,230
This is why there is a special button - "Save all" - it saves all opened files.

35
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:48,230
And since we have started to talk about linked files, I'd like to say a few words about images.

36
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,360
Just like as importing external animation files...

37
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:56,180
...when we import an image, its content isn't copied into the animation file.

38
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:00,590
instead. the animation file references the contents from the image file.

39
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:06,940
If we edit original image file, then it will be automatically updated in our animation.

40
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:11,560
The only difference is that changes don't happen immediately.

41
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:16,050
We have to close and re-open the animation file to see the changes.

42
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:20,760
Finally, one more thing you have to know when you work with linked files.

43
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:27,000
If you want to transfer your animation to other computer, you will have to be sure to move all linked files.

44
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,200
For image layers...

45
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,250
...you can see and change the path to the source file here...

46
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,180
...in this parameter.
