#9: Walkcycle

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:10,000
So we have first three steps of our character walking.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,000
I guess you've got he idea how to continue that.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:18,100
But I bet in most cases you would like to save your efforts and create a looped walkcycle.

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,800
So let's take a look.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,380
Obviously, we need to loop the interval from frame 0 to 32.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,660
But we exclude the frame number 32, because it is exactly the same as frame 0.

8
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,960
We don't want to repeat it twice, right?

9
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,200
First, we have to make the character to walk in place.

10
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,200
This is the position of the fore leg.

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,200
Now in frame 32 we move the whole group backwards...

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,600
... so the fore leg aligns to its original position.

13
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,620
Oops, the circle marker is in same the group with the character...

14
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,100
Let's create one outside of it.

15
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,400
And now we can move the group.

16
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:28,460
Notice, because the keyframes, we have an extra waypoint HERE.

17
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,060
But we need a whole character motion start from 0.

18
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,460
Let's fix it.

19
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,200
And this last waypoint should be removed.

20
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,600
Done! Now our guy walks in place till the frame 32.

21
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:55,160
And we don't care what will happen after that, because I'm going to add a Time Loop layer now.

22
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,360
But first, we need understand filter layers.

23
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,660
Usually layers are used to display something in working area: ...

24
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,830
circle, rectangle, bitmap artwork, etc.

25
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:14,860
But in Synfig there are a special layers that can change the look (or behavior) of underlying layers.

26
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,960
These are called Filter Layers.

27
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,730
Let me demonstrate an example.

28
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,200
Create two circles. A blue and a red one.

29
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,660
Select the upper circle..

30
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,560
...right-click it, and choose "New Layer".

31
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,060
Let's choose the "Blur" filter layer.

32
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,430
Surprise, everything is blurred.

33
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,600
We can adjust the blur amount on the Parameters panel...

34
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,860
...or right in the canvas by moving this dot.

35
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,400
Filter layers are only affect layers below them.

36
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,430
If we move the blur-layer down

37
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,300
See, now only the red circle is blurred.

38
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:16,000
But what if I'd like to blur only the blue circle above...

39
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,000
...and keep the red one unchanged?

40
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:26,030
To do that, just move the layer up, above the blue circle, and group them together.

41
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,980
So you see filters affects only the layers in the same group.

42
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,530
In the "New Layer" menu we have a lot of filter-layers...

43
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,360
... many different distortions and other interesting effects.

44
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,930
Right now we need a Time Loop layer.

45
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,500
This layer takes a fragment of animation from the layers below and continuously repeats it.

46
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,460
Let's get back to our character.

47
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,330
Turn the Animation Mode off...

48
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,560
Now add a Time Loop layer.

49
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,000
Set its Duration to 31.

50
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,900
As you probably remember we don't need to include the frame number 32.

51
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,630
Now all's ready and we have an endless walkcycle.

52
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,160
Let's save the file.
