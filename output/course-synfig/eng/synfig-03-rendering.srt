#3: Rendering

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:08,390
Our first animation is ready. It's pretty simple, but that's only the beginning!

3
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,000
Now we are going to render our project.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:23,530
Rendering is the process of converting the animation into a video file or into a series of still images.

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,220
Click on this button to open the Render Settings dialog.

6
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,970
Let's render our animation into AVI file.

7
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:41,680
Type "first-animation" in the Filename field. And add ".avi" as the extension.

8
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:51,100
You can also click the "Choose..." button to specify the path for the rendered video.

9
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:03,680
Basically that should be enough. By default Synfig will use the lossless H.264 codec.

10
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,100
This format provides compression without any loss of quality...

11
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,600
...and this is a perfect choice if you plan to put your animation in a video editing software for merging scenes or adding sound.

12
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,600
But if you need use a different codec, then ueg the following actions.

13
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,810
Choose "ffmpeg" from the Target dropdown.

14
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,180
The "Parameters" button becomes active.

15
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,430
Click it to open another configuration dialog where you can choose the video codec...

16
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,850
...and the bitrate.

17
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:41,020
In our case we are pretty happy with default values so let's leave everything as is.

18
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,970
At the bottom part of the dialog we can set parameters like image width and height.

19
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:52,560
Switch to the Time tab to specify the timespan you'd like to render.

20
00:01:53,930 --> 00:02:01,680
Everything's ready, so just click "Render" and wait until a message "File rendered successfully" appears at the bottom of the Canvas window.

21
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,350
The resulting file will be saved in the specified location.

22
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:21,020
To render the project as an animated gif, add a .gif file extension to the filename...

23
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,390
...and choose a "magick++" from the Target dropdown.

24
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,180
Let's check the resulting gif in the specified location.

25
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,730
If you'd like to render the current frame as a single PNG image...

26
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,930
...change the file extension to .png...

27
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,930
then switch Target to "Auto"...

28
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,900
...and activate the "Render current frame only" checkbox.

29
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,660
And here's the result.

30
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:20,930
Finally, I'll show one more type of rendering that is often used by professionals when they want to render animation preserving background transparency.

31
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:29,140
A transparent background allows us to combine animation with other clips or enhance it with effects in editing or compositing applications.

32
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,060
In this case rendering is performed as a sequence of PNG images.

33
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:43,600
The settings are the same as when rendering a single frame, except the "Render current frame only" checkbox needs to be unchecked.

34
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,900
Click "Render" and wait.

35
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,770
In this mode we also will have compression without any loss of quality...

36
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:59,530
...so it's a good option if your video editor doesn't supports the H.264 lossless format that we've mentioned in the very beginning.

37
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,260
The result is a series of images ready for loading into a non-linear video editor.
