00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,460
#6: Face animation

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:09,730
Now our character can move. It's time to make him talk.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,760
In the "mimic" folder I have several head images.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,260
Switching them at a certain frequency creates an illusion of a talking character.

5
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,930
That's what we are going to do.

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:35,560
Let's create a new file and quickly assemble our character. Just as we did before.

7
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,160
Now we need to import the head images.

8
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,380
Select the files with numbers from 1 to 5.

9
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,060
The sixth file we keep for later.

10
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,230
Now let's group those heads together.

11
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:23,300
But for this case I will be using a special Switch Group instead of the regular one. Here.

12
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,130
The Switching group behaves just like an ordinary group...

13
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,400
...but it shows only one of its child layers at a time.

14
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,300
This group have a special parameter called "Active Layer Name"...

15
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,800
...which defines the name of layer to display.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,900
Let's change it, to make our character close his mouth.

17
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,100
Press Enter. Done.

18
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,930
If we change this parameter in the Animation mode...

19
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:59,030
...the new waypoints will appear and the layers will be switching.

20
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:04,330
Now let's put head inside of this group.

21
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,000
Choose "Cut"...

22
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,960
Select this layer...

23
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,060
...and "Paste".

24
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,630
Notice that new layers are always inserted right above of the selected one.

25
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,560
Now let's import audio file with a voice of our character.

26
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,600
Choose "File" -> "Import"...

27
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,260
...and in the "mimic" folder select "sound.wav".

28
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,900
Let's listen to an audio track.

29
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,730
So, we've got two phrases.

30
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,430
Let's mark the beginning and the end of each phrase with keyframes.

31
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,500
Done.

32
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,730
Now we're going to switch head images in this and that intervals.

33
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,260
Turn the Animation mode on...

34
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,130
...go two frames ahead...

35
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,200
...and switch the first layer.

36
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,960
Now further a bit more...

37
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,960
and so on.

38
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:51,200
Right now I won't going to try to perfectly synchronize mouth shapes with voice.

39
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,630
Instead, I will place them randomly - that should be enough for now.

40
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,100
Let's check out the result.

41
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,600
Okay, he is talking now.

42
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,600
In this example all our head images are of the same size, so we don't have any problems.

43
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:20,060
But suppose if we want to add an extra head image with a different dimensions.

44
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,360
Import "head-extra" file...

45
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,300
And place it into the switch group.

46
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,030
It's not visible for now. Let's switch in on at some moment.

47
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,430
See? The guy's head jerks aside.

48
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,560
That's because the image doesn't coincide with the others.

49
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,330
So we have to adjust it.

50
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,700
But it's not that easy, because I can't see other heads at the same time!

51
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,060
So here we will use a Onionskin mode.

52
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:22,160
When Onionskin is enabled we can see an image from the previous keyframe.

53
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,500
Now it's become easy to align the image.

54
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,720
Just don't forget to switch the Animation mode off before you start, or else nasty miracles would happen.

55
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,700
Select the head image... and adjust.

56
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,330
Done.

57
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,000
Now everything works as expected.
