1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:04,000
Now, let's try to improve our animation even more.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:09,210
Look - the elements of the background are moving with different speed.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,050
That creates an illusion of depth and makes our animation more impressive.

4
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,860
This effect is called parallax.

5
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,350
And in this lesson I'll show you how to achieve it.

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:26,620
First, we'll need a background separated into layers.

7
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,440
Go to "bg-forest-2"...

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,070
...and here we can find three components of our background.

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,800
Let's start with the first one.

10
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:42,210
Please make sure to group it before scaling down.

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,940
In this way we won't need to manually scale every other piece of the background.

12
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:54,250
We need a long background, so I create a copy of this image holding SHIFT button...

13
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,530
...and move it to the left.

14
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:03,140
Now group these two layers and name it number one.

15
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,600
Let's import the next piece.

16
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,900
Move it into a group and it automatically scales to the proper size.

17
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:12,900
Put it into the right place.

18
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,330
Now make a copy, align it...

19
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,120
Done.

20
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,380
Also make a group and name it number "2".

21
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,050
And the last part.

22
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,710
Move it into the group and put to the right place.

23
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,270
Great. Now we have a beautiful long background.

24
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,400
We only miss the sky.

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,160
I'm going to use Gradient Tool to create it.

26
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,270
Let's choose proper colors.

27
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,360
And this one is better to keep white.

28
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,610
Activate Gradient Tool and make sure that you have linear gradient type enabled in the parameters panel.

29
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:22,640
I strongly recommend you to try other types of gradient later in your free time.

30
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,740
Now let's drag a vertical straight line on the workspace.

31
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,730
Here it is. We have a gradient.

32
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,870
You can tweak it by moving this control points.

33
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,410
The background is ready now.

34
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,750
Now, let's import our character.

35
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:43,530
You probably remember that it's located in "character-2", "final".

36
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,870
Here it is.

37
00:02:45,940 --> 00:03:00,360
Now let's animate the background in the same way as we did in previous lesson.

38
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,750
Set the Reds Mark. Turn on the animation mode. Go to 14th frame.

39
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:18,600
Move the background. Set linear interpolation here. And go to the end of our animation.

40
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:23,420
Now on the Graphs Tab set the final position of the background.

41
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,810
Done.

42
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:44,330
Now we have exactly the same animation as in previous lesson.

43
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,490
By the way, this red circle can be hidden now.

44
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,300
And this waypoint also can be removed.

45
00:03:51,300 --> 00:04:00,490
Now let's get to the magic of parallax effect. Click group number two and add a "Translate" layer above it.

46
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:08,900
Background layer number two is more distant than trees on layer "1". And that means it should move slower.

47
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:16,090
So, we have to move this layer in the direction opposite to the background "1" movement.

48
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,680
The background is moving to the right...

49
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:27,800
...so we will move layer "2" to the left. Like this.

50
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:32,630
Look, we have already got some feeling of depth.

51
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,220
Let's do the same for Layer "3". Add "translate" layer...

52
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,460
...and move it to the left.

53
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,050
Done.

54
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:52,640
Congratulations, we've just made an animation with parallax effect!
