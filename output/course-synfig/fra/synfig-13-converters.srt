1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:07,100
In this lesson, I would like to tell you about

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,930
Let's take a look at this sample

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:17,030
Now, let's try to guess how many waypoints

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,460
18, 9 or 5?

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,730
The correct answer is...

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,500
Synfig Studio has powerful features

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,500
and now, I'm going to demonstrate them

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,930
Here we have a bee body and

9
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,000
Let's import bee and

10
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,300
Group them together

11
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,230
and scale

12
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,030
like this

13
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,630
Move the wing into the right place

14
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,300
and set its rotation center

15
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,300
Now we are going to add

16
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,930
In Synfig Studio, you can attach mathematical

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,430
Let me demonstrate how it works

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,430
Here, we have a circle

19
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,960
Let's select its origin parameter

20
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,950
right-click

21
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,120
and choose "Convert"

22
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,950
Here, we got a list of available functions

23
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,470
in Synfig Studio we call them Converters

24
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,020
Choose Random converter

25
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,200
Look

26
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,150
Now, our circle makes random movements

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,900
Notice that there is a small triangle mark

28
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,420
Click on it to see

29
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:01,750
The Link sub-parameter represents

30
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,450
Here, we can set a maximum Radius of variation...

31
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,100
Speed...

32
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:25,700
or Seed

33
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,250
This Seed value defines

34
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,950
To remove converter from parameter,

35
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:50,400
As you probably noticed, the random converter made influence to both X and Y axes of origin parameter

36
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,350
Now, let's try to make it influence only its X axis

37
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,170
To achieve this

38
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,820
add a plain Composite converter for Origin parameter

39
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,450
This converter doesn't produce any animation

40
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,070
but it splits our parameter to

41
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,400
Now, again, let's right-click on X sub-parameter

42
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,270
and choose Convert

43
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,020
Random

44
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,970
Now, our circle is randomly moving

45
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,500
and finally

46
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,450
I would like to show you one more

47
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:48,420
This converter changes

48
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,300
Linear Velocity

49
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,850
Let's attach it instead of Random function

50
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,150
It's not really necessary

51
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,620
Then I'm attaching Linear converter

52
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,670
the old values have been

53
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,450
Let's set "Rate" value to 1

54
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,170
You can see our circle is moving

55
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,020
and this movement is infinite

56
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,070
Now, let's get back to our bee

57
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,270
So, we want to animate a wing

58
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,950
For this, I set a Random converter to its Angle parameter

59
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:41,000
Right now, this gives almost no effect

60
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,720
That's because the radius value is set to 1

61
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,720
that means that maximum variation of

62
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,700
Let that Radius to 30

63
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,400
Much better!

64
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,620
But the wing moves too slow!

65
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,500
Let's set Speed value to 25

66
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,500
Great!

67
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,900
Let's take a look at the graphs

68
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,620
and yes... Make sure that you have

69
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,320
So... We have one wing animated

70
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,070
Let's copy it

71
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,150
Put it down

72
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,120
Move here...

73
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,770
and scale down a bit

74
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,850
We have a really cute bee now!

75
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,020
Notice...

76
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,850
that the second wing has a

77
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,970
that's because the Random converter got

78
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,740
We can make wings move synchronously

79
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,540
We have to assign the same seed value to both

80
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,960
Like this

81
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,220
But for my taste, it's better

82
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,020
So, let's revert our last changes

83
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:29,460
Now, let's make our bee to fly from

84
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,140
Join on Animation Mode

85
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,500
Set initial position

86
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,280
and final position

87
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,040
Now, it's flying

88
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,600
Right now, the trajectory of

89
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,740
but it would be very great to make

90
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,060
then the animation will look more realistic

91
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,200
Let's do that

92
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,380
In here, we will use the Random converter again

93
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,880
To make the things easier,

94
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,200
Now, it remains at the same place

95
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,120
We can create one more group

96
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,700
and attach a Random converter

97
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,460
But instead, I will show you

98
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:40,580
You probably remember that Synfig Studio

99
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:46,680
and here we will use one very simple filter

100
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,660
Here it is

101
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,240
See

102
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,420
This layer is very simple and

103
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,020
Now, I am attaching Random converter to it

104
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,420
Set Radius to 15

105
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,460
Done

106
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,480
Now, again, let's make our bee move from

107
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,020
Let's check the result

108
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,340
As you can see...

109
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:34,900
the Linear motion combines together with Random

110
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,460
You are probably wondering...

111
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:44,180
What is the advantage of the use of

112
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,980
Now, in this particular case

113
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,360
there is actually no advantage

114
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,200
but in some cases this approach

115
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,720
because it allows easily turn off the Translation effect

116
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,700
Look

117
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:05,900
So, we can easily enable and disable

118
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,880
It's very simple

119
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:15,860
Such approach with filter layers is especially

120
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,100
And finally, one last stage for our animation...

121
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,100
Let's add a background

122
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,760
So, that's all, our animation is finished now!
